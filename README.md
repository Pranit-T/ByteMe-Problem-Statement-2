# Byte Expert (ByteMe) - AI Agent Framework

Byte Expert is an advanced Dual-Mode AI system that orchestrates dynamic, domain-specific AI personas capable of deep technical analysis, while simultaneously evaluating generic "base model" responses for hallucinations and assumed context.

It features a modular backend built with FastAPI, a sleek frontend powered by React and Framer Motion, and robust permanent cloud storage via Supabase.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Dual AI Response Modeling
Every query submitted to Byte Expert is processed through two distinct lenses simultaneously:
* **The Expert System (Domain-Specific):** Grounded by strict structural constraints, cognitive roadmaps, and domain-specific rules. It filters out outside noise and strictly adheres to the requested persona (e.g., Software Engineer, Agriculture Expert, Civil Engineer, etc.).
* **The Base Model (Generic):** A control response generated by an unconstrained LLM.

### 2. Hallucination & Depth Auditing
Byte Expert doesn't just provide an answer — it critiques the industry standard. After a query is run, the system automatically audits the **Base Model** against the **Expert System**. 
It highlights domain-specific nuances the base model missed, calls out generic advice, and assigns a precise `0-100% Hallucination Score`.

### 3. Custom Agent Creation & RAG Uploads
Users aren't limited to system defaults. The platform allows for the creation of completely custom AI agents.
* Upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files to generate rulebooks on the fly using Groq's `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` model.
* Agents are saved permanently to a **Supabase PostgreSQL database** and persist across sessions.
* **Chat Quick Upload:** Instantly generate new agents by uploading files directly in the chat input bar.

### 4. Headless API-as-a-Service
Byte Expert exposes an OpenAI-compatible REST API (`POST /api/v1/chat/completions`). It effortlessly integrates into external tools like **Cursor, LangChain, or Flowise**, allowing developers to use their Custom Agents entirely headlessly while maintaining all strict guardrails and core directives.

### 5. Custom API Key Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK)
Bypass server-level API rate limits via the interactive Developer Modal. Users can safely securely inject their own:
* **Groq API Keys** (Llama 3.1)
* **OpenAI API Keys** (GPT-4o Mini)

*These keys are securely stored in the browser's `localStorage` and never permanently written to the backend database.*

### 6. Graceful API Degradation (Fault Tolerance)
If the primary Base Model proxy (OpenAI) fails due to quota exhaustion or network timeout, the backend automatically logs the error and dynamically falls back to a secondary Open-Source model (Groq) to ensure the UI remains fast, fluid, and crash-free.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranit-T/ByteMe-Problem-Statement-2.git
cd ByteMe
```

### 2. Set up the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory:
```env
# Define the fallback API keys
GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YOUR_KEY"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_KEY"

# Authentication for API-as-a-Service
BYTEME_API_KEY="sk-byteme-beta"

# Supabase Credentials for Custom Agents
SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```

Start the FastAPI Web Server:
```bash
# Uvicorn will start on http://localhost:8000
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Set up the Frontend
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the Vite Development Server:
```bash
# Runs on typically http://localhost:5173
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Supabase Schema

If you wish to manage your own Custom Agents, set up your Supabase SQL Editor with the following snippet:

```sql
create table public.custom_roles (
  role_name text primary key,
  core_directive text not null,
  expert_rules jsonb not null,
  roadmap jsonb not null,
  knowledge_base text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

alter table public.custom_roles enable row level security;
create policy "Allow public access" on public.custom_roles for all using (true) with check (true);
```

## 📌 Usage

* **Live Demo:** Click "Run Live Demo" in the left sidebar to execute a highly complex, pre-programmed scenario comparing an Agriculture Expert against a standard Base Model.
* **Developer Options:** Click the `API` icon in the top right to set custom LLM keys or grab the standard `cURL` request snippet for your custom agents.
* **History:** Click on past chats in the left sidebar to instantly review previous conversations and hallucination audits.

**Enjoy building with Byte Expert!** 🚀
